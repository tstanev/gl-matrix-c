gl-matrix-c
===========

This repo contains a trivial copy-paste C port of the JavaSciprt [gl-matrix](http://glmatrix.net/) library.

The goal is to use the ported code for performance comparisons of plain JavaScript vs. WebAssembly.

Refer to the [original repo](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) for licensing information.

That's it, that's all.
